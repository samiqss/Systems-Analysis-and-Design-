Contribution:

Because only Pete was able to help with implementing the website. I tried to split the project between us, but his code was way off. 
So I decided that it was faster to do the whole thing from scratch by myself. But I will sit with everyone this Friday and test the final project together.
So far Search, View, List Ideas are completed. Almost done testing and fixing Create. Need four hours to hopefully complete the Edit page. Now that I am sure we are on track I will have pete and maybe caleb, if he can remember a few thing from last year, to help out with finishing edit and testing the whole project.
