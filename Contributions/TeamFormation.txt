1) First filled out my sections in the RolesAndResponsibilities file.

2) Once everyone had some time to fill in their part in the RolesAndResponsibilities file, I filled in the missing sections and reviewed the overall file with the team.

3) Completed my personal SkillsInventory file.

4) Typed up TeamContract and TeamFormation files after brainstoring with team members.

Note: Tony created the initial Templates.

(Not sure with what is meant by including the TeamFormation file, so I will include only the sections I worked on here)
